# Paper Reviews

You are expected to write and submit a paper review of the readings before each class, and answer some questions about the readings.  The review should be akin to a conference paper review.  The purpose of the readings is to provide an illustrative example of the research area.  You are encouraged but not required to read the supplemental readings to better understand the materials.  

You can discuss questions and ask for clarifications with your colleagues and/or on piazza.  You are expected to formulate your own opinion of the reading(s) and write the review yourself.  See for a description of what we expect in paper reviews.  

We may select a random review to read and discuss in class.  This serves to highlight important characteristics of reading papers and writing good reviews.


### Submission

The first reviews ([System R](#lec2), [Postgres](#lec3)) are special, so look at the paper description for submission details.  


Otherwise, follow the following instructions: 

* [Submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/uNfVx9jUBXdj6wXd2)
* Reviews are due **10PM EST day before lecture**.  
* Late submissions are given a score of 0 without prior approval.  
* You may miss submissions for up to **2 lectures**.


### Reading Tips

Ask the following questions while readings

* What is the context of this work?
  * What was the unmet need or opportunity?  Does it make sense?
  * What were existing approaches and why do they work or not work?
  * What is the simplest example that highlights the problem that this approach works best for?
  * Does the paper (and its contributions) matter?
  * What are the actual hypotheses?
* Approach
  * How do they seek to validate their hypotheses? Do they make sense?
  * Is the evaluation cursory or deep?
  * Do you believe their results?
  * Are the results presented well?

# The Papers

### System R Overview 

Readings 

* Required: <a href="./files/papers/systemr-retrospective.pdf">System R Retrospective</a>
* Optional: <a href="./files/papers/ingres-retrospective.pdf">Ingres Design</a>


Paper Review 

* System R was an impressive research and engineering effort, and the reading is a retrospective of the 6 year project.  
* The paper discusses "the Convoy Problem".  Discuss the problem:  What is it?  Why does it exist?
* The paper discusses many many topics.  Identify and pick one aspect (different than the convoy problem) that you are particularly impressed with.  Discuss what and why.
* Note: The format of this review will be different than future reviews because this is a warmup paper

Submission

* Due: 12PM Thursday 1/24

Paper Review

Below are a few aspects of the readings to think about.  I have randomly assigned teams to think about each aspect.
After I release paper reviews, discuss among your team what your consensus response will be.
Teams will elect a leader to present their consensus in class.


* Problem: Jennifer, Yiru
  * What problem is this idea/system solving?  Is that important?  Why?  Provide evidence.
* State-of-the-art: Dean, Alan
  * What was the previous state-of-the-art (in the same field or other fields)? How, and how much does this system advance state of art?   Justify with evidence.
* How?   Yiliang, Amita
  * How does the idea/system work? What are the key insights? Provide concrete examples that highlight extreme design points.
* Results: Maryam, Xiao
  * How SHOULD the technique be evaluated?  How was the technique evaluated?   What were key results?
* The Future: Haneen, Andrew
  * What would follow-on research to this paper be?  Propose an actual design of the research.  e.g.,
    * Improve an algorithm in the paper;   
    * Find a new, significant evaluation question for it;   
    * A brand-new way to address the same problem/goal. 
* Applier:  Shikun, Xinyue
  * Think beyond this paper.  What is the most different interesting application/use case that this paper (or its ideas) enables?  Justify.
* Hater: Ziao, Siyang
  * Identify the deepest weaknesses in the paper.  Identify flaws in both categories below, and describe how to address the weaknesses:
    * The technical work: are there limitations or flawed assumptions?  Look for aspects that break the paper.  
    * The presentation of the paper: look for poorly explained portions, logical inconsistencies, argumentation that is flawed.
