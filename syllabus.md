#### Overview

Topics will likely include:

* High performance, data-intensive systems (e.g., Spark, HTAP/OLAP, Streaming, ML systems)
* Modern data cleaning (e.g., integration, quantitative cleaning, data fusion)
* Data-intensive visualization (e.g., [DVMS](https://cudbg.github.io/lab/), approximation, exploration)
* Collaborative data analytics (e.g., data lakes)

#### Course Expectations

What I expect from You

* Students are expected to *actively participate* in class discussions; participation is mandatory.
* Students should be comfortable reading research papers; you will read, answer questions, and comment on the readings before class.
* Students should be comfortable coding data processing systems;  familiarity with database query execution, some machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
* Students should be comfortable conducting a research project and writing up the results in a research paper format.

#### Participation

Participation is mandatory.  
Since the course is small, it is expected that students will help contribute to the in person and online discussions.  This includes:

* Asking and answering questions related to the class's readings and lectures.  
* Making observations about the lecture's relationship with products or society 
* Asking and answering questions on piazza

**Students that do not actively participate will receive a 0 in the course**.

#### Paper Reviews (every class)

See [./reviews](./reviews) for a description and expectations for paper reviews.



#### Homeworks


For Homeworks, you allowed 5 penalty free late days to use throughout the semester. One late day equals one 24 hour period after the due date of the assignment. Once you have used your late days, the assignment will be 0.    There is no need to tell the staff that you are using the late day.



#### Project (semester long)

You will pursue a [semester long research project](./projects) related to this course.
The project is a significant part of the course grade.

#### Midterm Exam

There will be an in-class written exam on 3/21 (after spring break).
The exam will be long-from questions based on the mandatory readings and topics discussed in class.
It will be closed notes.

A corallory is that your conduct is respectful and encouraging to your fellow students.

#### Extra Credit

The purpose of extra credit is to reward learning and doing cool stuff.  Propose activities that the course doesn't cover nor force you to do, and convince me how much extra credit (up to 10%) you should receive.  Some _possible directions_:

* apply diffusion of innovation, or any other adoption theory, to a subarea of databases.  Present it
* suggest an above-and-beyond target for your project
* learn a topic/system/etc not covered and teach us
* implement a paper/idea 
* _your crazy idea here_


## Collaboration/Copying Policy

Refer to [Columbia's academic honesty policy](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/) if you are at all unsure.

You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution, you are not allowed to look at solutions from previous years, and you are not allowed to look at solutions from other universities. You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code. The same rule holds for the question assignments: you must write all answers yourself, not look at others' answers, but you can discuss the questions with others at a high level.
You are also not allowed to look for or at solutions to the homeworks on the Internet. You can search for small pieces of code that solve small parts of your homeworks, and you may use tutorials to learn, however if you copy any code from anywhere, we request that you identify the origin in a comment in the code.

Be advised that we will be running all assignments through the MOSS code similarity tool, which is very accurate even after significant amount of obfuscation, so we will identify and report anyone who attempts to breach this rule. We will include in our tests solutions from previous years both from Columbia and elsewhere. Both copy-ers and copy-ees will be punished. You are responsible for protecting your code and homeworks from others and not leaving them lying around in publicly open directories.

Finally, you may discuss the questions for each question assignment with other students, but you may not look at other students' answers. You must write your answers yourself.
