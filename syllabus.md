#### Course Expectations

* Students are expected to *actively participate* in class discussions; participation is mandatory.
* Students should be comfortable reading research papers; you will read, answer questions, and comment on the readings before class.
* Students should be comfortable coding data processing systems;  familiarity with database query execution, some machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
* Students should be comfortable conducting a research project and writing up the results in a research paper format.

#### Participation

Participation is mandatory.  


Since the course is small, it is expected that students will help contribute to the in person and online discussions.  This includes:

* Asking and answering questions related to the class's readings and lectures.  
* Making observations about the lecture's relationship with products or society 
* Asking and answering questions on piazza

#### Paper Reviews (every class)

See [./papers](./papers) for a description and expectations for paper reviews.



#### Homeworks


For Homeworks, you allowed 5 penalty free late days to use throughout the semester. One late day equals one 24 hour period after the due date of the assignment. Once you have used your late days, the assignment will be 0.    There is no need to tell the staff that you are using the late day.



#### Project (semester long)

You will pursue a [semester long research project](./projects) related to this course.
The project is a significant part of the course grade.

#### Midterm Exam

There will be an in-class written exam on 3/21 (after spring break).
The exam will be long-from questions based on the mandatory readings and topics discussed in class.
It will be closed notes.

A corallory is that your conduct is respectful and encouraging to your fellow students.

#### Extra Credit

Propose an extra credit activity and convince me how much extra credit (up to 10%) you should receive.  Some _possible directions_:

* apply diffusion of innovation, or any other adoption theory, to a subarea of databases.  Present it
* suggest an above-and-beyond target for your project
* learn a topic/system/etc not covered and teach us
* implement a paper/idea 
* _your crazy idea here_

#### FAQ


What's the relationship between the different database courses?
(solid lines are prereqs, <span style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dashed">blue dashed lines</span> are recommended).

What's the difference from [6111 Advanced Database Systems](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/cs6111/schedule.html)?

* Both [6111](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/cs6111/schedule.html) and this class (6113) are continuations of 4111, in that they dive deeper into the research
  literature and more advanced topics.  6111 focuses a lot on information retrieval and the web 
  (essentially, viewing the web as a big "database").  This class focuses on the research
  and design of database internals and systems design.  
* Take a look at the readings for both classes to get a better sense of the difference!

What's the difference from [4112 Database System Implementation](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/4112s18/)?

* 4112 is a continuation of 4111.  It dives deeper into the topics typically mentioned in the second half of 4111, such as indexing, query optimization, transactions and concurrency control, and durability.
  This class primarily covers more "established" content found in database management textbooks, and may sometimes refer to papers when appropriate.
* In contrast, 6113 is heavily oriented around reading research papers and conducting research.
  6113 will read research literature that ultimately led to some of the ideas covered in 4112, but will also cover more
  advanced database systems research as well.


Can I take both 6111 and 6113 for credit?

* Yes.




## Collaboration/Copying Policy

Refer to [Columbia's academic honesty policy](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/) if you are at all unsure.

You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution, you are not allowed to look at solutions from previous years, and you are not allowed to look at solutions from other universities. You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code. The same rule holds for the question assignments: you must write all answers yourself, not look at others' answers, but you can discuss the questions with others at a high level.
You are also not allowed to look for or at solutions to the homeworks on the Internet. You can search for small pieces of code that solve small parts of your homeworks, and you may use tutorials to learn, however if you copy any code from anywhere, we request that you identify the origin in a comment in the code.

Be advised that we will be running all assignments through the MOSS code similarity tool, which is very accurate even after significant amount of obfuscation, so we will identify and report anyone who attempts to breach this rule. We will include in our tests solutions from previous years both from Columbia and elsewhere. Both copy-ers and copy-ees will be punished. You are responsible for protecting your code and homeworks from others and not leaving them lying around in publicly open directories.

Finally, you may discuss the questions for each question assignment with other students, but you may not look at other students' answers. You must write your answers yourself.
